# CVE-2020-13405
MicroWeber is an open-source Content Management System (CMS) written in PHP. It allows web administrators to easily build a website by dragging and dropping components where they want them to be. It is a popular choice among those looking to start a website that is both easy to set up and is very customizable.

`userfiles/modules/users/controller/controller.php` in Microweber before `1.1.20` allows an unauthenticated user to disclose the users database via a `/modules/` `POST` request.
